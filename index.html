				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>
					Global supply chains are complex systems, often responsible for shipping products from several
					origin nodes to several transshipment nodes, and then on to several destination nodes. In a
					transshipment problem, the objective is to determine how many units should be shipped over each arc
					in the network so that all destination demands are satisfied with the minimum possible
					transportation cost. Linear programming helps solve these network flow problems by providing a
					mathematical means to determining the most efficient flow of goods throughout the distribution
					network to minimize costs.

					<h4>The Problem</h4>

					<p>
						For this example I selected the following case problem from the textbook <i>Introduction to
							Management Science: Quantitative Approach</i>:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							The Darby Company manufactures and distributes meters used to measure electric power
							consumption. The company started with a small production plant in El Paso and gradually
							built a customer base throughout Texas. A distribution center was established in Fort Worth,
							Texas, and later, as business expanded, a second distribution center was established in
							Santa
							Fe, New Mexico.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							The El Paso plant was expanded when the company began marketing its meters in Arizona,
							California, Nevada, and Utah. With the growth of the West Coast business, the Darby Company
							opened a third distribution center in Las Vegas and just two years ago opened a second
							production plant in San Bernardino, California.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							Manufacturing costs differ between the company’s production plants. The cost of each meter
							produced at the El Paso plant is $10.50. The San Bernardino plant utilizes newer and more
							efficient equipment; as a result, manufacturing cost is $0.50 per meter less than at the El
							Paso
							plant.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							Due to the company’s rapid growth, not much attention had been paid to the efficiency of its
							supply chain, but Darby’s management decided that it is time to address this issue. The cost
							of shipping a meter from each of the two plants to each of the three distribution centers is
							shown in <span style="color: dodgerblue;">Table 6.10</span>.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							The quarterly production capacity is 30,000 meters at the older El Paso plant and 20,000
							meters at the San Bernardinoplant. Note that no shipments are allowed from the San
							Bernardino plant to the Fort Worthdistribution center.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							The company serves nine customer zones from the three distribution centers. The forecast of
							the number of meters needed in each customer zone for the next quarter is shownin <span
								style="color: dodgerblue;">Table
								6.11</span>.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							The cost per unit of shipping from each distribution center to each customer zone is given
							in <span style="color: dodgerblue;">Table 6.12</span>; note that some distribution centers
							cannot serve certain customer zones.
							These are indicated by a dash, “—”.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px">
							In its current supply chain, demand at the Dallas, San Antonio, Wichita, and Kansas City
							customer zones is satisfied by shipments from the Fort Worthdistribution center. In a
							similar
							manner, the Denver, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix customer zonesare served by the Santa Fe
							distribution center, and the Los Angeles and San Diego customer zones are served by the Las
							Vegas distribution center. To determine how many units to ship from each plant, the
							quarterly
							customer demand forecasts are aggregated at the distribution centers, and a transportation
							model
							is used to minimize the cost of shipping from the production plants to the distribution
							centers.

					<h4>Managerial Report</h4>
					<p>
						You are asked to make recommendations for improving Darby Company's supply chain by answering
						the
						following questions:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Draw a network representation of the Darby company's current supply chain map. If the
							company does not change its current supply chain, what will its distribution costs be for
							the following quarter?</li>
						<li>Suppose that the company is willing to consider dropping the distribution center
							limitations; that is, customers could be served by any of the distribution centers for which
							costs are available. Can costs be reduced? If so, by how much? </li>
						<li>The company wants to explore the possibility of satisfying some of the customer demand
							directly from the production plants. In particular, the shipping cost is $0.30 per unit from
							San Bernardino to Los Angeles and $0.70 from San Bernardino to San Diego. The cost for
							direct shipments from El Paso to San Antonio is $3.50 per unit. Can distribution costs be
							further reduced by considering these direct plant-tocustomer shipments? </li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Solution 1</h4>
					<p>
						The first step is to draw a supply chain map showing all of the potential shipment arcs out of
						the production plants and distribution centers under the current structure. <span
							style="color: dodgerblue;">Figure 1</span> shows
						graphically the 14 distribution routes (arcs) Darby company can use. The ammount of supply
						available is written next to each origin node, and the amount of demand is written next to each
						destination node. The cost per unit of shipping from each node is written on the arc for each
						route.
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<h5><span style="color: dodgerblue;">Figure 1.</span> Network map</h5>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to open in a new tab" src="images/Transshipment network diagram.png"
								alt="Transshipment network diagram" class="center">
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						A linear programming model is used to solve this transshipment problem to determine the minimum
						cost under the given constraints. I used double-subscripted decision variables based on the
						labels I gave in the network diagram above, with XA1 denoting the number of units
						shipped from origin A (El Paso) to destination 1 (Fort Worth), XA2 denoting the number of units
						shipped from origin A (El Paso) to destination 2 (Santa Fe), and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because the objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, I used the cost data in
						<span style="color: dodgerblue;">Table 6.12</span> or on the arcs in <span
							style="color: dodgerblue;">Figure 1</span> to develop the following objective function:
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 14px;">
						<i>Min</i> 13.7X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">A1</sub> +
						12.7X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">A2</sub> +
						14.7X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">A3</sub> +
						13.9X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">B2</sub> +
						11.2X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">B3</sub> +
						0.3X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">14</sub> +
						2.1X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">15</sub> +
						3.1X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">16</sub> +
						4.4X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">17</sub> +
						2.7X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">28</sub> +
						4.7X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">29</sub> +
						3.4X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">210</sub> +
						2.1X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">311</sub> +
						2.5X<sub style="position: relative; top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;">312</sub>
					</p>
					<p>
						This objective function ensures the lowest total cost through all possible distribution routes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Transshipment problems also require several constraints for each of the shipment nodes. For
						origin nodes, the sum of the shipments out minus the sum of the shipments in must be
						less than or equal to the origin supply. For destination nodes, the sum of the shipments in
						minus the sum of shipments out must equal demand. For transshipment nodes, the sum of the
						shipments out must equal the sum of the shipments in.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on the requirements listed in the problem description, I came up with the following
						constraints:

						The optimal solution projects that total transportation costs for the next quarter, given the
						current constraints, will amount to $620,770. The El Paso plant is slated to ship 14,520 units
						to the Fort Worth Distribution Center and 13,700 units to the Santa Fe Distribution Center. The
						San Bernardino plant, however, is expected to ship only 13,840 of its 20,000-unit capacity to
						Las Vegas, with no shipments to Santa Fe. At the Fort Worth Distribution Center, 6,300 units
						will be distributed to Dallas, 4,880 units to San Antonio, 2,130 units to Wichita, and 1,210
						units to Kansas City. Meanwhile, the Santa Fe Distribution Center will dispatch 6,120 units to
						Denver, 4,830 units to Salt Lake City, and 2,750 units to Phoenix. Lastly, the Las Vegas
						Distribution Center will distribute 8,580 units to Los Angeles and 4,460 units to San Diego.
					</p>
					<h4>Solution 2</h4>
					<p>
						To determine if costs can be reduced if the company is willing to consider dropping the
						distribution center limitations, I present an updated graphic representation of the distribution
						network along with a modified linear program below in <span style="color: dodgerblue;">Figure
							3</span> and <span style="color: dodgerblue;">Figure 4</span>.

						The green arrows highlight new potential distribution routes. Fort Worth can now ship to
						customers in Denver, while Santa Fe can extend its reach to customers in Dallas, San Antonio,
						Wichita, Kansas City, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Additionally, Las Vegas can now serve
						customers in Denver, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix. The supply and demand levels remain unchanged,
						as do the restrictions on the origin nodes.

					</div>
					<p>
						If Darby Company were to lift the distribution center restrictions, it could save a total of
						$19,828 in shipping costs. By adjusting the constraints, some of the demand could be shifted
						from the El Paso production plant to the San Bernardino plant, allowing it to ship its full
						capacity (20,000 units) to Las Vegas. Since the transportation costs per unit are lower from Las
						Vegas to Salt Lake City ($3.30) and from Las Vegas to Phoenix ($2.40) compared to shipping from
						Santa Fe to Salt Lake City ($4.70) and from Santa Fe to Phoenix ($3.40), the company would
						benefit from dropping these restrictions and utilizing the more cost-effective distribution
						routes.
					</p>
					<h4>Solution 3</h4>
					<p>
						Allowing direct shipments from El Paso to San Antonio, and from San Bernardino to LA and San

						that 4,460 units are shipped directly from San Bernardino to San Diego. This solution report
						highlights a $248,876 reduction in the total cost by implementing these direct-to-customer

				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>
					The ultimate goal of higher education institutions is to prepare students for successful careers and
					graduate highly qualified candidates into the workforce for the betterment of society.
					Unfortunately, there are many obstacles and barriers to accomplishing this goal. As of 2021, only
					33.7% of the population aged 25 and over have completed a bachelor’s degree or higher in the U.S. <a
						href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=s1501&tid=ACSST5Y2021.S1501" class="major">(US Census
						Bureau, 2022)</a>, while total enrollment has declined by 1.3 million
					students at public colleges and universities in the United States between 2010 and 2020 <a
						href="https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/trends-in-college-pricing-student-aid-2022.pdf"
						class="major">(Ma & Pender, 2022)</a>.</p>

				<div class="read-more-container">
					<p>
						One of the biggest challenges that higher education institutions face is student dropout rates.
						Of all the students that enroll in a college institution, more than half fail to complete their
						degree <a
							href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markkantrowitz/2021/11/18/shocking-statistics-about-college-graduation-rates/?sh=7134423b2b69"
							class="major">(Kantrowitz, 2021)</a>. Understanding the reasons why is a crucial first step
						toward addressing the problem and improving graduation rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						Early detection and intervention for students at risk of dropping out can significantly improve
						their chances of success. Armed with the right information, educational decision-makers can help
						provide the right resources at the right time to the students who need them. In addition,
						institutions can use this data to make changes to university operations that can help facilitate
						improved graduation rates, such as introducing hybrid and online learning models, DEI
						initiatives,
						or the reallocation of resources.
					</p>
					<p>
						A machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a student will drop out or graduate
						can provide necessary insights and recommendations that enable universities to address the
						issues causing students to drop out and develop strategies to improve student success. In this
						analysis, I utilize a Kaggle dataset made available by <a
							href="https://www.kaggle.com/naveenkumar20bps1137" class="major">Kancharla
							Naveen Kumar</a> to analyze student success factors and develop multiple supervised machine
						learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to classify
						students into two categories, "Dropout" or "Graduate". The goal is to get the predictive model
						to correctly label 90% of students into the correct classification.
					</p>
					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>
						Based on the results of this analysis, the logistic regression model produces the best overall
						fit metrics and is the optimal supervised machine learning model to accurately predict student
						dropouts in this sample population. The logistic regression model accurately predicts 90% of
						student dropouts and can be used to target communications and allocate resources to help prevent
						students at risk and only two semesters' worth of data, and the results may not generalize to
						other institutions. In addition, the lower recall scores on all three models suggest that
						additional features, including student income factors, housing status (on or off campus), grade
						point average, employment status, and even faculty data, could be added to help improve the
						accuracy and reliability of the results to produce fewer false negative results.

							alt="HR Attrition Visualization" /></span></a>
				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>
					This project is my entry into the Data In Motion LLC monthly data viz challenge. The assignment was
					to take on the role of an HR people analyst to find insight on termination trends, department
					turnover, salary, diversity rates, and more
					for over 4,000 (not real) employees. I decided to take the approach of creating a dashboard to help
					us understand what is driving attrition at the company, and what we can do to reduce employee
					turnover.</p>
				<div class="read-more-container">

					<h4>The Result</h4>
					<p>After review, I have concluded there is insufficient data to determine the root-cause of
						attrition at the company. However, I suspect that the major contributing factors could have to
						do with the company's salary structure and people practices.
						These factors appear to have been amplified during COVID, as demand and competition have grown
						for certain types of roles, and more people in Software, Sales, and Marketing started finding
						better opportunities and better salaries. I have the
						following recommendations to help identify the root-cause:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I highly recommend that the company conduct additional research to reevaluate whether their
							salary is competitive with the market. The departments with the highest turnover impact are
							Software, Sales, & Marketing, so I would suggest starting
							here with research.
						</li>
						<li>I recommend that the company conduct a deep dive to determine the equity of their pay
							structure between race and gender, as well as across education levels and qualifications. In
							my research I found that African Americans are consistently paid
							around $16,000 below average across all education levels, and employees holding masters
							degrees (the highest qualification) are paid less than all other education levels.
						</li>
						<li>I suggest that the company implement a targeted exit survey that is consistent across
							departments to clarify additional details and reasoning behind voluntary exits. Since the
							top 3 reasons: Better salary, more flexible benefits, and found a better
							opportunity could have the same underlying cause, a supplemental survey could help clarify
							the reason for leaving. The survey should offer questions and capture notes from the
							employee about job fit, compensation, company culture, and leadership
							satisfaction. By better understanding the reasons for leaving, we can effectively determine
							a path toward employee retention.
						</li>
						<li>Without performance related data it is impossible to tell whether the company is losing top
							performers due to increased competition, or losing performers across the entire rating
							scale. I recommend adding performance factors to the dataset,
							along with the previous mentioned recommendations so we can deep dive further.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Preparing the data</h4>
					<p>In my initial exploration of the data I combed each field for accuracy and consistency, and to
						familiarize myself with the dataset. One thing that I noticed was inconsistencies in some of the
						gender values. For example there were 19 males recorded as "lesbian" and 7 females
						recorded as "gay". To handle these for visualization purposes, based on the gender options
						available I assigned any females listed as "gay" to "lesbian", and any males listed as "lesbian"
						to "gay". Perhaps an early indication of
						the company's lack of diversity, but there were only 2 employees who identified themselves
						outside of the Male/Female gender as "Other."</p>
					<p>Another thing I noticed about the data was that we only had termination data through March, 2022,
						and the last hire date was December 31, 2021. Since I am unable to determine if this is an
						incomplete data set (missing hire info for
						2022), I operated under the assumption that the company has not hired any new employees in 2022
						yet, and the data collection period ended in March.</p>
					<p>Finally, I noticed that Tenure is listed in months, so for simplicity in the visuals I converted
						this value to years to the nearest tenth decimal place.</p>
					<h4>Analysis</h4>
					<p><u>Overview</u>: To establish a baseline for the diversity of the company, I created several
						elements to look at some basic statistics such as the number of active employees, number of
						ex-employees, attrition %, salary, age, and the tenure of active vs. ex-employees. I put
						these stats inside of BANs at the top for at-a-glance information as the dashboard is filtered.
						Beneath, I added a histogram to display the company's attrition trend during the time period
						covered in the dataset. For added flexibility, I also decided to add filters at the
						top of the dashboard for gender, education, and race, so that the user could deep dive any or
						all of these diversity factors.</p>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p><u>Gender, race, & age</u>:Once I had the basic stats identified, the next thing I put together
						was the demographic visuals to see diversity by gender, race, and age. Based on my initial
						exploration of the data, I already suspected the company would have opportunities here.
						To represent gender I decided to use donut charts to show active vs. inactive employee count
						along with the % of the total population for each gender. I deliberately chose to use color in
						my visuals to represent active vs. inactive employees, so as to not reinforce gender
						or racial stereotypes, like the much used pink/blue color palette to represent women and men. In
						the gender mix I found approximately 60% male vs. 40% female, along with only 2 employees
						(0.04%) who identified outside of male or female. According to census data, approximately
						2.3% of the population identifies as transgender or non-binary<sup><a
								href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity.html">1</a></sup>.
					</p>
					<p>While creating a visual for race, I chose to use donut charts as well. I felt this gave the best
						representation of each race, all as a part of the whole with equal representation and
						visibility. Within the racial mix, I found that Caucasian makes up approximately 75% of the
						organization, while the second largest group is Asian with just over 10% representation,
						followed by African American, Hispanic, Native American, and "Other," accounting for a combined
						total of 13.74% of the total population. Although minority groups are underrepresented in
						the company, the disparity really presented itself in the salary data (more on that later...).
					</p>
					<p><u>Age</u>: The best way to represent the age structure of the company was to present it in a
						vertical column chart. I created 5 bins in which to group employees: &#60;25, 25-34, 35-44,
						45-54, and 55+. I found that roughly 77% of the company was made up of employees between ages
						25-44, while people ages 45+ make up a combined total of 8.27% of the company.
					</p>

								<h6>Diversity charts</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p><u>Attrition</u>: After getting to know the composition of the company from a people perspective,
						it was time to look at actual attrition data. I looked at attrition in several different ways,
						but ultimately I landed on 3 visuals to help identify who was leaving the company and why.
						I wanted to investigate attrition by tenure, by department, and by reason. Starting with tenure,
						I noticed that 82% of turnover within the first year was voluntary, while 18% was involuntary.
						High voluntary turnover in the first year could indicate that new employees are having a
						hard time adjusting to, or feeling accepted by the current culture. </p>
					<p>When investigating attrition by department, I noticed that Software and Sales combined for
						approximately one-third of all voluntary terminations. No particular sub-departments stood out
						as a significant source of turnover within the categories, however, both are highly competitive
						roles that have grown in demand since the start of COVID.
					</p>
					<p>To attempt to answer the question of why employees are leaving, and spiked from 2021-2022, I
						created a visual to see termination reasons by department. Here I discovered a common theme that
						"better salary," "more flexible benefits," and "found a better opportunity"
						were consistently the top 3 reasons for voluntary terminations across all departments.
						Unfortunately, however, this does not fully answer the question of why people are leaving. Since
						many people may place "better salary" under the umbrella of "found a better opportunity," we
						would
						need additional data to find the driving causes of each selection. The voluntary reason list is
						also missing questions relating to job satisfaction, company culture, and leadership
						satisfaction, which automatically places those factors into a more generic bucket.
					</p>
					<p>I also checked to see which populations have the highest attrition rates. I found that:
					<ul>
						<li>Employees with the job type Manager have the highest attrition rate (20%) compared with all
							other job types. As I looked into this further, I found that the top reason for manager
							terminations was
							"better salary" across nearly all departments.</li>
						<li>Native American employees have the highest turnover by race at 23.08%, while African
							Americans have the lowest turnover (13.64%). </li>
						<li>Employees holding a masters degree have the highest attrition of any education level at
							18.91%</li>
						<li>Females have a slightly higher attrition rate than males, with 18.42% compared to 17.07% for
							males</li>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p><u>Salary</u>: Fair and equitable compensation is always an important factor in employee
						retention. To analyze the salary structure of the company I chose to make two column charts,
						each with a constant reference line indicating the average salary for all employees. One chart
						shows
						salaries for active employees, and the other shows salaries for ex-employees. I also added
						filters for the entire dashboard to allow me to view salary data by gender, race, and education.
						I felt that there were a few anomalies that were worth further investigation by the company:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>African Americans were consistently paid around $16,000 below average across all education
							levels (also recall that they have the lowest attrition rate)</li>
						<li>Employees holding a masters degree, which is the highest qualification, were paid the least
							of all education levels. In fact, in the case of female employees, people with no degree at
							all were paid the highest, over $2,300 more than employees holding a masters degree.</li>
						<li>Former female employees made significantly more on average than active female employees,
							which is the largest discrepancy between active and inactive employees.</li>
						<li>Former employees made more on average than active employees across the board, yet the
							average tenure of active employees exceeds that of former employees by 4.7 years.</li>
					</ul>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>Although we are not able to difinitively conclude that current attrition is caused by salary, the
						company's salary structure and practices clearly need to be reevaluated by management to ensure
						fair and equitable pay across races, gender, qualifications, and job performance.</p>
					<p>Improving the pay structure will help reduce the heavy costs of employee turnover, and ensure the
						company is retaining its top talent, while replacing low performing individuals with diverse
						talent from all races and backgrounds. Adding job performance data, job satisfaction ratings,
						and additional exit survey questions to this dataset will help pinpoint the root causes of
						attrition, and help us identify the right actions to take to make the best decision for the
						business and make progress toward employee retention and job satisfaction.

				<h4>Intro</h4>
				<p>What better way is there to get to know me than through interacting with my experiences? I recently
					saw a LinkedIn post showing some of the creative ways people have made interactive
					r&eacute;sum&eacute;s in
					Tableau and I was inspired to create my own. </p>
				<div class="read-more-container">
					<h4>Purpose</h4>
					<p>I decided to make this r&eacute;sum&eacute; to showcase my technical and creative skills to
						potential employers in the analytical space. When people think "Store Manager" they don't always
						associate it with the same
						skills and responsibilities as a Business or Data Analyst, however, the roles have some
						extraordinarily similar qualities.
					<p>
					</p>A Store Manager, much like a Data Analyst is responsible for analyzing their business using
					whatever analytical tools available to them (Excel, SQL, Tableau, etc...) to identify patterns and
					trends in the data that help themselves, or their businesses make better decisions. They then take
					this information and put it together
					in various forms to communicate their findings and best practices with their peers, managers, and
					other key stakeholders in weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reviews. Unlike a Data Analyst
					however, Store Managers are then responsible
					for developing their own action plans, and then communicating the solution and leading their teams
					to execute the plan from end-to-end while maintaining responsiblity over success or failure.</p>
					<p>In this interactive r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you get to see my professional background in a unique
						way, with additional context that wouldn't fit in a typical one-pager. My work and educational
						history are presented in a rounded Gantt chart
						in the center, with my hard and soft skills represented in the horizontal bubble chart below by
						half-circles (soft skills) and triangles (hard skills). Something that is not included in my
						r&eacute;sum&eacute; yet is that I have applied
						to receive my master's degree in Global Supply Chain Management at Portland State University,
						which starts in the Spring of 2023. Once I get admitted I will add it to my timeline as
						in-progress.

							alt="Retail KPI dashboard" /></span></a>
				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>In this project I wanted to create a retail KPI dashboard that is simple, yet delivers a ton of value
					to field leaders. The end user wants to be able to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Flexibly filter by location</li>
					<li>See performance period-over-period</li>
					<li>Compare performance across stores/regions/markets</li>
					<li>Identify which categories, sub-categories, and products drove the biggest performance wins and
						losses</li>
					<li>Customize how they can drill into their KPIs to create their own stories based on their uniqe
						challenges</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="read-more-container">
					<h4>Preparing the data</h4>
					<p>The first thing that I did to set up the data was to join the Orders table with the Returns and
						People tables, and bring this static dataset up to the current time by using the expression:
					<p>
					<pre><code>DATEADD('day', DATEDIFF('day',{MAX([Order Date (new)])},TODAY()-1),[Order Date])</code></pre>
					<p>After deciding what I wanted to include in the dashboard and how I wanted users to interact, I
						started by creating custom date parameters to allow the user to either pick from a list
						of common periods (Yesterday, Week-to-date, Month-to-date, etc...), or select their own custom
						date range on which to compare sales. </p>
					<pre><u>Select Date parameter</u>: Sets the list of date options for the user to select.</pre>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/Select Date parameter.webp"
								alt="Tableau parameter" class="center">
						</div>
					</div>
					<pre><u>Select Date parameter filter</u>: Uses CASE statement to identify whether the KPI falls into the selected date range or not.
									<code>CASE [Select Date]<br>WHEN 1 THEN DATEDIFF('day', [Order Date], TODAY())  = 1<br>WHEN 2 THEN DATEDIFF('week', [Order Date], TODAY()) = 0  AND [Order Date] &#60; TODAY()<br>...<br>WHEN 12 THEN [Order Date] &#62;= [Start Date] AND [Order Date] &#60;= [End Date]<br>END</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Comparison Date filter</u>: Uses CASE statement to identify whether the KPI falls into the date range for the previous period so that the differences and % change can be calculated.
									<code>CASE [Select Date]<br>WHEN 1 THEN DATEDIFF('day', [Order Date], TODAY())  = 2<br>WHEN 2 THEN DATEDIFF('week', [Order Date], TODAY()) = 1 AND DATEPART('weekday', [Order Date]) &#60;= DATEPART('weekday', TODAY())<br>...<br>WHEN 12 THEN [Order Date] &#62;= [Start Date] - [Custom Date (Days in Range)] AND [Order Date] &#60;= [End Date] - [Custom Date (Days in Range)]<br>END</code></pre>
					<p>I then created a paremeter list for users to filter by their desired KPI. Each KPI has a
						calculation that refers to the selected period and the comparison period, as well as the
						difference,
						% change, and a directional "arrow" to symolize increase, decrease, or flat based on the
						difference between periods.</p>
					<pre><u>Select KPI parameter</u>: Sets the list of KPI options for the user to select.</pre>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/Select KPI parameter.webp"
								alt="Tableau parameter" class="center">
						</div>
					</div>
					<pre><u>Selected period KPI</u>: Gets the KPI value within the selected date range.
									<code>IF [Select Date Parameter Filter] = TRUE<br>THEN [Sales] ELSE 0 END</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Comparison period KPI</u>: Gets the KPI value within the comparison period range.
									<code>IF [Comparison Date Filter] = TRUE<br>THEN [Sales] END</code></pre>
					<pre><u>KPI difference</u>: Calculates the difference between the selected date and comparison date.
									<code>ZN(SUM([Sales (Selected Date)])) - ZN(SUM([Sales (Comparison Date)]))</code></pre>
					<pre><u>KPI % change</u>: Calculates the % change between the selected date and comparison date.
									<code>(SUM([Sales (Selected Date)]) - SUM([Sales (Comparison Date)]))<br>/<br>SUM([Sales (Comparison Date)])</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Directional arrows</u>: Shows whether the selected KPI has increased, decreased, or remained flat period vs. period.
									<code>IF [Sales Difference] = 0 THEN "▶ " END<br>IF [Sales Difference] &#60; 0 THEN "▼ " END<br>IF [Sales Difference] &#62; 0 THEN "▲ " END</code></pre>
					<p>Finally, I calculated the custom KPIs such as ASP (Average Sale Price) and UPT (Units Per
						Transaction) and started building my worksheets.</p>
					<h4>Design</h4>
					<p><u>Executive Dashboard</u>: This dashboard provides a high-level overview of the business for
						Regional Managers and above to identify KPI trends at a global level. I wanted the most
						important metrics to be displayed front and center
						at the top of the page in what are called BANs (Big A** Numbers), to provide quick context and
						key takeaways on the business's current performance. </p>

					<p><u>Field Dashboard</u>: As an ex-Store Manager, this dashboard has the information that I would

						segment, category, sub-category, and customer-level data. Similar to the Executive dashboard,
						major KPIs that are most relevant to Store Managers are located in BANs at the top of the
						report. Just below,
						users can see the current performance trends by Segment and Category/Sub-Category. Rather than
						creating another view for Category (which contains only Furniture, Office Supplies, and
						Technology), I allow them to use the filters at the top
						to control this level of detail in each view.</p>

					</div>
					<p>At the bottom of the Field dashboard I created views for the user to see their top and bottom
						products for each KPI. Managers are able to identify which products are contributing the most
						and least value to their business
						so they can make adjustments at the local level to drive sales or fix issues causing poor
						performance. When I was a store manager, bottom sellers often would often uncover inventory
						discrepancies preventing products from being sold
						that wouldn't have been discovered otherwise. Depending on the business, the ability to see
						customer level data can help managers build important relationships with customers.</p>

					<h4>Data Literacy</h4>
					<p>To promote data literacy and help users understand how to operate the reports, each dashboard has

						dynamically highlights the top performing location or product based on the filtered KPI, as well
						as the period vs. period change.</p>

				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>This case study is the capstone project in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on
					Coursera. I was provided a dataset from Kaggle on which to analyze trends in fitness tracker usage
					to answer key business questions and make high-level recommendations for a wellness brand's
					marketing strategy (Bellabeat).</p>
				<p>In this project I take on the role of a data analyst working on the marketing analytics team at
					Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful
					small company, but they aspire to become a larger player in the global smart device market.
					I have been tasked with focusing on one of Bellabeat's core products and analyzing smart device data
					to gain insight into how consumers are already using their devices. The Insights I discover
					will then help guide the marketing strategy for the company.</p>
				<div class="read-more-container">
					<u>Key business questions</u>
					<p>To get started, I was asked to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers
						use non-Bellabeat smart devices. The following questions will guide my analysis:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>What are some trends in smart device usage?</li>
						<li>How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?</li>
						<li>How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>About the data</h4>
					<p>I was provided a dataset on which to perform my analysis:
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit"> FitBit Fitness Tracker Data</a>
							(CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through <a
								href="https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic">Mobius</a>): This Kaggle data set
							contains personal fitness tracker from thirty three fitbit users.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Thirty three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data,
						including minute-level output for physical activity,
						heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart
						rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
						However, this dataset has several limitations to keep in mind as I explore the data:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>The sample size is extremely small, and not all users had 100% participation.</li>
						<li>There is no way to determine the gender of participants. Since Bellabeat specifically
							designs products for women, this data set may not be the best representation of Bellabeat's
							target audience.</li>
						<li>Not all devices tracked the same information (i.e. sleep and weight log data), so results
							using that data will be less reliable.</li>
						<li>This data set is 7 years old. Both Bellabeat and Fitbit have since come out with new devices
							and technology that have impacted the way people use their devices.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
					<h4>Preparing the data</h4>
					<p>After creating a database in MySQL and importing all of the csv files, I started by checking the
						basic statistics and cleaning the data. I went through and
						removed duplicate records and outliers that would skew the data, renamed and formatted columns
						for consistency, and merged tables to compare sleep and weight log data alongside
						other daily activity. I have uploaded my SQL scripts with detailed notes to my <a
							href="https://github.com/Chaser260/Bellabeat-Marketing-Case-Study-Tableau">GitHub</a> page.
					</p>
					<h4>Designing the dashboard</h4>
					<p>I decided to make this a Tableau story where I could present my findings in a similar method as a
						PPT presentation. There are 4 different slides excluding the title page.
					<p>
					<p><u>Overview</u>: I provide a brief explanation of the project and the business task.</p>
					<p><u>Analysis</u>: I briefly describe the tools I used to complete the analysis, and the questions
						I wanted to answer while exploring the data.</p>
					<p><u>Results</u>: I summarize my high level recommendations I for Bellabeat regarding how this
						information can help guide marketing strategy.</p>
					<p><u>Interactive Dashboard</u>: I compiled some of the key insights I found into an interactive
						dashboard with visuals for the various activities. In a presentation, these would likely
						be static images that display my results, however, for this particular project I wanted to give
						real viewers the chance to customize their interaction with the data. Therefore, the horizontal
						activity bar chart and the
						sleep vs. activity scatter are both able to to be filtered for different activities.</p>

				<h2><a title="View on GitHub" href="https://github.com/Chaser260/PDX-weather" class="major">PDX Weather
						Analysis With RStudio</a></h2>
				<a title="View on GitHub" href="https://github.com/Chaser260/PDX-weather"><span class="image main"><img
							src="images/pdx_weather_analysis.webp" alt="Weather visualization project" /></span></a><br>
				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>I'm fascinated by climate change and weather related events. To develop my skills with the program
					language R, I pulled real climate data for the PDX weather station dating back to 1938 from
					NOAA.gov, to help me visualize what climate in Portland has looked like over the last 84 years.</p>
				<p>Prior to moving to Portland in 2011, I lived in Bend, OR. Growing up, all I ever heard about was how
					wet and rainy Portland was. People made it sound like Portland never saw the sun. In my exploration
					of the data, I found some interesting facts relating to precipitation, snow, and temperature change
					in Portland. All this Portland data made me curious to compare it to my home town of Bend, OR.
				<p>
				<p>Spoiler alert! Although the average temperature in Portland has been rising over the past 80 years,
					temperatures in Bend have actually declined! </p>
				<div class="read-more-container">
					<b>Preparing the data</b>
					<p>To start this project, I used the tidyverse package and the read_csv function to establish a live
						connection with the NOAA.gov site that provides the .csv file for the PDX weather station.
						Since the data didn't originally have column headers in the source file, I had to manually
						locate those in the README file and add them to my import. After determining the columns that I
						needed,
						I imported the data and performed a pivot_wider function to change it from long format to wide
						to get each of the variables into separate columns. The only variables I was interested in were:
						date, tmax, tmin, prcp, & snow. I also had to use the lubridate package to adjust
						the date format to be in ymd format instead of just a string of numbers. Once my table format
						was established, I saved it to a variable called pdx_weather, and saved it as the source file on
						which
						to run future analyses. Now, I can come back to it at any time and run the script to get updated
						climate data.</p>
					<h4>Analysis</h4>
					<p>The first thing I wanted to look at was precipitation and snow data. To get started it's always a
						good idea to make sure the data makes sense. I first went through and checked for outliers by
						visualizing the data using a line plot and a histogram.
						I initially thought there might have been something wrong with the snow data, but after
						searching the date on Google, I discovered that over 40 inches of snow actually did dump on
						Portland in January of 1950!
						See the figure below:</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/pdx_cumulative_snowfall.webp"
								alt="Portland snowfall" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>PDX snowfall 1950</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>To get a better look at snow in Portland, the next thing I did was organize the data so that I
						could see snow by month. This would allow me to see when it typically starts and stops snowing,
						and which months get the most snow. To do this I had to reorganize the calendar into
						a "snow year", which puts any snow that occurs before August is added to the previous calendar
						year's snow season. I learned that the latest it has ever snowed in Portland is May (1953), and
						the earliest it has ever snowed was October (1950). Portland also has 9 years on record with no
						snow.
						I came up with the following visual with a nother striking view how snow is distributed
						throughout the year:

					<div class="image fit">
						<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/pdx_snow_by_month.webp" alt="Portland monthly snow"
							class="center">
						<div class="description">
							<h6>PDX snow by month</h6>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>After checking the data for anomalies, I moved on to plotting precipitation in a way I could see
						each year and compare current precipitation to the average precipitation for the last 84 years.
						I created a line plot where each line represents the cumulative precipitation for a single year.
						I then added code to highlight the current year in blue, all other years in light gray, and the
						mean precipitation in a black smoothed curve. I found that as of June, our precipitation was
						higher than average, but I was really intrigued to find out what year had the massive spike
						that dumped over 60 inches! I created the two plots below to find out:
					</p>
					<div class="image">

								alt="Portland precipitation record 1996" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>PDX precipitation 1996</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>This was all very interesting and fun to learn, but I really wanted to know whether it has been
						getting wetter or drier over the last 84 years. I also thought it would be a good idea to put
						this on a line plot.
						I figured I should see which direction the temperature has been moving also to find out if there
						is a relationship between temperature and precipitation. I created the faceted line plot below
						to see this relationship:
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/temp_precipitation_line.webp"
								alt="Portland temperature vs. precipitation correlation" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Temperature Vs. Precipitation</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Then I put tmax and prcp into a scatterplot and ran a correlation test:</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/temp_precipitation_scatterplot.webp"
								alt="Portland temperature vs. precipitation correlation" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Temperature Vs. Precipitation 2</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>No significant relationship exists between temperature and precipitation.</p>
					<h4>Temperature</h4>
					<p>2022 was a hot year, so I wanted to dive deeper into this temperature change next. I wanted to be
						able to see how the average temperature in 2022 compared to historical temps. I found a few
						interesting ways to visualize this.</p>
					A line chart that shows PDX temperature change (above or below the normalized mean) by month, with
					2022 highlighted in dodgerblue, and all other years in light gray. You can see in this chart that
					July through October were some
					of the hottest months on record, between 5-10 degrees hotter than average.</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/pdx_average_annual_temp.webp"
								alt="Portland average temperature" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Temperature Vs. Precipitation 2</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>During our record heatwave during summer of 2022, I saw a scatterplot posted on Twitter that
						visualized the record heat in California and I figured out how to reproduce the same visual for
						Portland. This chart has the daily high temps in
						gray for each day dating back to 1939, and the current month of interest highlighted in
						dodgerblue, and a dotted white line representing the normalized mean temp on which I compared. I
						found that both September and October of 2022 were
						the hottest September and Octobers on record at PDX.</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">

								alt="Portland record temperatures" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Record Heat</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I can honestly say that this has been my favorite project so far because I can come back to it at
						any time to update any of the visuals to reflect recent events. I learned a ton about
						R programming, and I'm excited to continue to produce more projects in the future. If you want
						to see my code with detailed notes, and the additional comparisons I made with Bend climate
						data,

							alt="Lebron James career stats" /></span></a>
				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>This was my first self-guided project using Tableau to create a visualization. I performed most of
					the heavy lifting in Excel prior to importing into Tableau. I'll go more into detail about how I
					processed
					the data in Excel below. I love following all the G.O.A.Ts in their respective sports, but I was
					particularly interested in putting it into a vizz. I decided to focus on Lebron because I knew he
					was getting
					close to breaking the all-time scoring record held by Kareem Abdul Jabar for the last 30 years. I
					wanted to see how he scored against each team he played against and at which arenas he plays best.
				</p>
				<div class="read-more-container">
					<h4>Process</h4>
					<p>For this project, I pulled dozens of tables from the nba.com stats pages and used powerquery to
						merge all of the files into a single Excel doc. To prepare the data for analysis, I used Text to
						Columns to
						separate Date, Team, OPP, and home vs. away into separate columns, and then I replaced the
						"vs."" and "@" symbols with "home" and "away". I used Google Maps to get the latitude, longitude
						and name for each stadium,
						and created a stadium reference sheet and used IF statements to populate the arena name, city,
						and state columns for each game. This allowed me to make the following transformation:</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/before.webp" alt="" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Before</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/after.webp" alt="" class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>After</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>From here, I used formulas to pull over his W's and L's for each opponent to the stadium list to
						summarize his W/L ratio to be used as a hotspot map in Tableau. I used the following formulas:
					</p>
					<pre>Wins and Losses<code>=COUNTIFS(lebron_career_stats!$J:$J, "W", lebron_career_stats!$C:$C,'stadium list'!A2)</code></pre>
					<pre>Win/Loss Ratio<code>=H2/SUM(H2:I2)</code></pre>
					<p>This was the result:</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/stadium_list.webp" alt="NBA stadium list"
								class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Stadium List</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Next I loaded this data into Tableau to begin visualizing. I wanted three basic elements to my
						dashboard:
					<ul>
						<li>A chart to see his average PPG against each opponent for each team he has played for </li>
						<li>A visual that shows his points scored in every game, the team he played for, and his
							opponent</li>
						<li>A visual that shows where he plays the best based on his W/L ratio</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Average points by opponent</h4>
					<p>For this visual I arranged Team dimension on the rows shelf and the OPP dimension on the columns
						shelf. I added AVG(PTS) to Label
						on the Marks card as well as to the color mark to create a highlight table. As the Lakers are
						his current team, I chose a color scale from white to purple to represent
						his performance. It's interesting to see that he has consistently performed worst agains LAC on
						all three teams he has played for, yet he performed much better against
						the Lakers even though they play in the same stadium. And he clearly holds a grudge against his
						former team in CLE, as he has a career best 34.6 points per game against the Cavs
						and a 94.4% W/L ratio.</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Radial Bar Chart</h4>
					<p>Being new to Tableau, this one took some help and inspiration from fellow vizz artists online.
						I've seen several radial bar charts while browsing
						through Tableau visualizations and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to learn how
						to create one. With the help of my good friend Youtube, I learned I needed to union
						my data to itself to create the calculated fields I needed:</p>
					<pre><u>Path Order</u>: Dimension that determines the inner and outer dots on each line<code>IIF([Table Name]="lebron_career_stats",0,1)</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Radial Field</u>: Determines the measure to be used and the length of the bars<code>[PTS]</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Radial Angle</u>: Looks down the table using the index function to give a form of ordinality and calculates which angle Tableau needs to plot each line<code>(INDEX()-1 * (1/WINDOW_COUNT(COUNT([Radial Field]))) * 2 * PI())</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Radial Normalized Length</u>: calculates the length of the bars and how far away from the center Tableau should plot the inner and outer points<code>[Radial Inner] + IIF(ATTR([Path Order]) = 0, 0, SUM([Radial Field])/WINDOW_MAX(SUM([Radial Field])) * ([Radial Outer]-[Radial Inner]))</code></pre>
					<pre><u>Radial X & Radial Y</u>: Trigonometry functions that calculate the point on the X and Y axis where we want to place the start and end points (COS for X & SIN for Y)<code>[Radial Normalized Length] * COS([Radial Angle])
								[Radial Normalized Length] * SIN([Radial Angle])</code></pre>
					<p>I also created two parameters called Radial Inner and Radial Outer so the normalized length
						calculation had something to work with.</p>
					<p>Now that I had all my calculations needed for the chart, the first step was to switch the chart
						type to line and drag the Path Order dimension onto the path card.
						Then drag the Radial X and Radial Y pills onto the columns and rows shelves respectively. Next I
						added the Date pill to the detail card to make each bar correspond to a particular game,
						and changed the calculations on the X and Y axis to compute using Date. From there, I just had
						to add the Team pill to the color card to see which team Lebron played on for each game
						and make some minor adjustments to the size of the circle, and voila! I had my chart.</p>

							<img title="Click to enlarge" src="/images/Radial Bar Chart.webp" alt="Radial bar chart"
								class="center">
							<div class="description">
								<h6>Radial Bar Chart</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Hotspot Map</h4>
					<p>The final step to have all of the elements for my dashboard was to utilize that location data I
						worked so hard for earlier and visualize his W/L ratio on a map.
						To do this, I added the Longitude pill to the columns shelf and the latitude pill to the rows
						shelf to get my map. Then I added the arena pill to the detail card to get the marks over
						each arena location. Finally, I added PTS to the size card and made sure it aggregated by AVG,
						and then W/L Ratio to the color card to make his best W/L ratio a deep shade of purple
						and his lowest W/L ratio a light gray.</p>
					<div class="image">
						<div class="image fit">

							<div class="description">
								<h6>Hot Spot Map</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>This was a great project to get me started on learning Tableau. It helped me find specific
						Youtube channels to subscribe to that can help me in future projects, and I got tons of practice
						finding answers through the Tableau community forums
						and Stack Overflow. If I had to do this project over, I would love to try to establish a live
						connection with the data so that it is easier to update and doesn't become outdated.</p>

				<p>Hi, my name is Chase, and I am a process-driven, solution-oriented individual passionate about
					solving problems and improving operational efficiency. I am a self-starter, motivated by
					opportunities to learn and apply new skills.
					I currently hold a bachelor’s degree in Business with an emphasis in Small Business Management &
					Entrepreneurship. In the Spring of 2023, started pursuing a Master of Science in Global
					Supply Chain Management at Portland State University with an expected graduation date of December,
					2024. Course topics include strategic planning, sourcing, logistics, business analytics (forecasting
					& optimization modeling), new product introduction, supplier relationship management, global
					contract negotiations, and leadership. The program also includes an international field study with
					over 10 factory visits to gain first-hand insights into global manufacturing processes and supplier
					operations.</p>
				<p>I have 17 years of retail leadership and analytical experience working directly with customers and
					front-line employees to deliver world-class retail experiences and business results. Most recently,
					I was responsible for building and developing a team of 15-45 retail employees and analyzing
					customer insights, sales KPIs, and operational metrics to generate data-driven insights and
					implement solutions to solve business and leadership challenges. As the Site Manager in a start-up
					environment, I planned, organized, implemented, and continuously improved several processes
					including omnichannel programs, Customer Returns, Digital Subscriptions, workforce management
					systems, inventory management systems, and more.</p>
				<p>I am currently looking to transfer my skills to a global organization where I can challenge myself to
					solve progressively difficult problems while continuously learning nea skills. My long-term goal is
					to grow with the company and continue to advance my knowledge, skills, and contributions at various
					levels of supply chain and business strategy. If you are a recruiter or a hiring manager, I would
					love to share how my experiences will add value to your team.
