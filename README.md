### Hi there 👋, welcome to my profile
#### My name is Chase

I've spent the last 17 years in retail working directly with customers and front line employees to deliver world-class retail experiences and business results. Most recently, I was responsible for managing a team of 15-45 retail employees and analyzing customer insights, sales KPIs, and operational metrics to generate data-driven insights and implement solutions to solve business challenges. I am highly motivated by tough challenges, and have spent  my retail career pursuing the best possible solutions and taking pride in helping others solve similar challenges. Over the last couple of years, I've discovered my passion in data and analytics. 

Outside of work, I am fueld by a passion for sport and competition: particularly NFL football and golf. However, some of my favorite games to play also include badminton, pickleball, and bowling. I am also becoming increasingly interested in saving the planet from self destruction 🌎💥 (not sure how yet, but the answer is in the data).  

I'm currently building out my portfolio. It will include projects relating to all of my interests in and outside of work. Please feel free to comment on my work, ask questions, or suggest topics for me to play with. Thank you for visiting!

If you are a recruiter looking to hire your next Data Analyst/Business Analyst, I would love to discuss how my 17 years of retail experience has me well qualified to fill the role! Connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/carlson-chase).
